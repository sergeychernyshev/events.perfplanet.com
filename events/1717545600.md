At June 5 NY Web Performance Meetup at Dotdash Meredith we'll have 2 talks:

### How Dotdash Meredith team approaches INP
Google's new Interaction to Next Paint (INP) Core Web Vital presents new challenges to businesses, with as much as ~18% of the web having "needs improvement" or "poor" INP and ~53% of pages fail Core Web Vitals overall.
Dotdash Meredith, America's largest publisher, will share how we have been transforming how we observe and optimize our sites in order to create better customer experiences on our pages.
In this roundtable talk Speed Team manager **Russell Brown**, Principal Engineer **Joseph Freeman**, Software Engineer **Tyron Goldschmidt** and Quality Assurance engineering will speak on how to better improve your monitoring, engineering, testing and planning for INP.

### Speed Design
Proper speed design is a collaboration between product managers, UI designers and developers as all the aspects of the page composition must be balanced to achieve fast experience.
**Sergey Chernyshev** will discuss how to start bringing speed into the design process early on and look at the most common set of design patterns that can help you drive design decisions.
